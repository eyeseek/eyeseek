## Project story

Eyeseek is a social app using blockchain technology and its financial properties to gamify day-by-day activities and reward good behavior that benefits all other app users.
Mobile and web applications contain three open functional frameworks, all with different purposes using game theory mechanisms to unite communities by doing common good:
1. Quests: Ask for help or Answer and get rewarded.
2. Shark tank: Promote ideas, services, products and get honest feedback
3. Chain funding: Gamified crowdfunding oriented on charity, science and education

Main motivation and challenge of this project is to spread the mentality that “being kind could be fun
too”, applying concepts where addictive social applications or games drain lifetimes for profit and
transform the effort rather into support of good deeds like self-improving, science and open-source
project contribution or charity donation. All in the environment where each user profits from the
application’s success.
